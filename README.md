# Deploy_ML_Model_into_cloud

In this project, we build a spam detector using machine learning and launch it as a serverless API into AWS virtual servers.
We use basic machine learning methods to build the spam detector and the Flask python framework to create the API.


Create a Flask application

Create a RESTful API - GET/POST Method

Build a spam detector ML model

Build a spam detector API

Launch an AWS EC2 instance(Virtual Server) using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Deploy your ML model(API) into AWS virtual servers.

Perform additional AWS Elastic Beanstalk actions: Application versioning, Server logs, Server performance monitoring & Terminate the server.

## Installation
git clone 
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Datasets
spam_train.csv: data used to train the model
spam_test.csv: data used to test the model

## Run in Terminal
